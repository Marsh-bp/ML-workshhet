3. Suppose that we are statistical consultants hired by a client to provide advice on how to improve sales of a particular product. The Advertising data set consists of the sales of that product in 200 different markets, along with advertising budgets for the product in each of those markets for three different media: TV, radio, and newspaper.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/advertising-dataset
What is the relationship between sales and TV budget?
Check whether Increasing sales through advertising is having an impact or not. Construct a confidence interval around the slope of a regression line.
Relationship between the sales and TV budget is linear
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
data = pd.read_csv("advertising.csv")
X = data["TV"]
y = data["Sales"]
X = sm.add_constant(X)  
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
slope = model.params["TV"]
conf_int = model.conf_int().loc["TV"]
print(f"Slope (beta1): {slope:.4f}")
print(f"95% Confidence Interval for Slope: ({conf_int[0]:.4f}, {conf_int[1]:.4f})")
